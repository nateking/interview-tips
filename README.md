Here are some interview tips when preparing for a Technical Phone Interview

Some general prep guide--no need to strictly follow it or anything :)


Focus Areas
- Coding ability in your preferred language
- Some system design, implementation, etc
- Domain Expertise, which for this role will include networking, distributed systems/infrastructure, linux proficiency, etc.
- Core CS, algorithms, and data structures

How best to prepare:
Read this article for some general context around technical interviewing.  Yes, I get that weâ€™re not Google, but their style of interviewing seems to have been adopted by almost every company so preparing for similar style will definitely not hurt.

If given a problem:

    Step back
    Maybe clarify that you understand the problem correctly
    Define interfaces
    Write code
    Walk through the code
    Look for bugs and address if you can
    Discuss limitations/tradeoffs of different solutions for each problem
    Understand current technologies to apply to a problem
    
Data Structures: 
One of the most important application design decisions involves which data structure to use. You should know the pros and trade-offs for the most common data structures and when to use what for the most optimal approach. You should also know the runtime complexities (where applicable) of each. Some examples:

Hash Table - Arguably the single most important data structure known to mankind. You absolutely have to know how they work and their underlying structure. 
You should be able to implement one using only arrays in your favorite language, in about the space of one interview.  
You should also be able to recognize and implement if and when a hash function is a more optimal solution.

Hash Set
Hash Map
Arrays
Linked Lists
Vectors
Trees
Binary Trees
N-ary trees
Trie-trees 
You should know about tree traversal algorithms and know the difference between inorder, postorder, and preorder. 
Heap

Algorithms:

Big-O Notation - You need to know Big-O. It's a must. If you struggle with basic big-O complexity analysis, then you are almost guaranteed not to get hired. It's like one chapter in the beginning of one theory of computation book, so just go read it.

Sorting - Know how to sort. Don't do bubble-sort. You should know the details of at least one n*log(n) sorting algorithm, preferably two (say, quicksort and merge sort). Merge sort can be highly useful in situations where quicksort is impractical, so take a look at it.



Let me know if you have any questions!
